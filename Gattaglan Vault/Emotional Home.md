<h6> Things to do to help protect you from your emotions.

---
1. Daily Gratitude Ritual
	Write down 3 things each day that you're greatful for.
	
2. Get a positive nag.
	Vision boards or dream boards. A visual or group of visuals reflecting your ideal life. Put it somewhere you see everyday.
	
3. Journaling
	Take time to process your emotions, both negative and positive each day. Somedays you won't feel that you have much to journal...so journal that.
	
4. Self-compassion.
	Be kind with yourself; treat yourself as you would treat others you love. "Don't worry, tomorrow's a new start."
	
5. Awareness
	Check in with your body and notice where and how strong the tension is. Stress can indicate negative emotions.
	
6. Labelling
	Once identified name your negative emotions. Be as accurate as you can and use 3 or more labels.
	
7. Replace it
	Once found and named replace your nagative emotion with a positive. We can think of something and be angry or sad and we can think of something and be happy or grateful.
	
8. "Flip" your anger
	Anger is the tip of passion, use it to energize constructive change or work.
		Ask: "What's triggering me - what's underneath this?"
		"What do I care about that's making me angry?"
		"What could I do to *use* that energy to move forward with this thing that's making me angry?"
	
9. Remember, something must change!
	All emotions, particularly negative ones, have "adaptive value" - meaning they can be used to help us cope and espond to difficult situations, because at the heart of every negative emotion is a sense that *something must change!*
